## Elements  
Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page. Some of the more frequently used elements include multiple levels of headings (identified as `<h1>` through `<h6>` elements) and paragraphs (identified as the `<p>` element); the list goes on to include the `<a>`, `<div>`, `<span>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` elements, and many more.

Elements are identified by the use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets, `< >`, surrounding the element name.
